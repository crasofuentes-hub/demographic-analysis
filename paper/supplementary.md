## S1. Parameterization
This repository currently uses illustrative parameter orders of magnitude consistent with typical Western high-income demographics, expressed as annual effective per-capita rates for a controlled simulation. For formal publication, provide a sourced parameter table (CSV) with explicit country/year references.

### S1.1 Realistic scenario parameters (illustrative)
- Initial population: Group A = 45,000,000; Group B = 10,000,000
- Fertility (annual effective per-capita): A = 0.018; B = 0.024
- Mortality (annual): A = 0.009; B = 0.007
- Net migration (annual): A = 0.000; B = 0.005
- Convergence rate (assimilation): 0.03

### S1.2 Extreme stress-test (non-empirical)
- Initial population: A = 50,000,000; B = 5,000,000
- Fertility: A = 0.010; B = 0.040
- Mortality: A = 0.012; B = 0.005
- Net migration: A = -0.002; B = 0.020
- Convergence rate: 0.00

## S3. Reproducibility checklist
- Python 3.12+
- Create venv: `py -V:3.12 -m venv .venv`
- Activate: `.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1`
- Install: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Run analysis: `python -m models.analysis`
- Generate figures: `python scripts/generate_figures.py`
- Sensitivity: `python scripts/sensitivity_analysis.py`

## S4. Notes on model scope
The model is aggregated (no explicit age structure). It is designed for controlled scenario comparison and falsification-style stress testing, not as a replacement for full age-structured national statistical projections.
